//FOUR BUTTONS FOR THE CANVAS
	// According to the third link in the top header comment, it is important initialize important ctx string
	var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas"); //gets connection between function and the canvas element in the HTML body. 
	var ctx = c.getContext("2d"); //String to be modified later on by fillStyle and fillRect.
	
	// (Button 1) Create a function that draws a rectangle onto the canvas.
		function drawRectangle() {
			ctx.fillStyle = "black"; //fill style is black
			ctx.fillRect(400, 100, 200, 100); //rectangle dimensions
		}

	// (Button 2) Create a function that writes my name onto the canvas.
		function printName() {
			ctx.fillText("raga ganji", 300, 365); //fills name (text) in the canvas.
		}

	// (Button 3) this function uploads an image onto the canvas.
		function loadImage() {
			var img = document.getElementById("image");
			ctx.drawImage(img,0,0,300,300);

	// (Button 4) this button resets (clears) the canvas.
